This project was created as part of a university course on vector graphics. The goal was to design and assemble a complete image using a variety of vectorization techniques.

The main subject of the piece is a tandem bicycle, with each part of the bike colored separately to highlight the structure and segmentation. The image was constructed using a combination of the following techniques:

- Manual vectorization by tracing — used for most of the bike frame and structure

- Overlay vectorization — used to create elements like the wheels, chain, and chainrings

- Automatic vectorization — applied to generate the dynamic ink-splatter background

This project allowed me to explore the different methods of constructing vector images and gave me hands-on experience with layering, shape composition, and color separation in vector-based design.
