This project involved creating a fully modeled 3D tandem bicycle and placing it within a custom-built scene. The work was done as part of a course focused on 3D modeling and rendering, using Blender as the primary tool.

Every element in the scene was crafted from scratch — including the bike frame, wheels, gears, and the environment itself. I also created custom materials and textures, paying attention to realistic reflections and surface details. The final scene was lit and rendered to simulate natural daylight and environmental interaction, including subtle weathering effects.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

- 3D modeling and geometry construction
- Procedural materials and texturing
- Lighting and scene composition
- Camera positioning and rendering in Blender
